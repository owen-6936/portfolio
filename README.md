# Owen Erhabor's Portfolio

## Project Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a dynamic and adaptive platform to showcase my journey, skills, and projects as an aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

Built with a focus on clean, minimalist design principles, this portfolio is initially being developed using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). My aim is to create a highly flexible content management system for this portfolio, allowing for seamless updates to project details, images, and content layouts without direct code modification. This approach reflects my dedication to building robust, scalable, and user-friendly web solutions.

## Technologies Used

This project starts with the foundational web technologies:

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout (including CSS Variables for theming).
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactive elements and dynamic behavior.

### Future Enhancements (Planned)

- **React:** For building a dynamic, component-based user interface on the front-end.
- **Node.js:** For the backend of the custom content management system (CMS) and portfolio updater software.
- **Database:** To store and manage portfolio content (projects, skills, etc.) dynamically.
- **Theme Switching:** Implementing light/dark mode functionality.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist & Clean Design:** Focus on readability and intuitive user experience.
- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Structured Navigation:** Clear navigation for easy access to all sections.
- **Home Page:** Concise introduction, top skills, and featured projects (planned).
- **About Me Page:** Detailed personal journey, skills breakdown, and motivations.
- **Projects Page:** Dedicated section to showcase individual projects with comprehensive details and visuals.
- **Contact Page:** Multiple ways to get in touch, including direct links and a contact form (planned).
- **404 Error Page:** Custom page for unhandled routes.
- **Theme Switcher (Planned):** User-selectable light and dark modes.
- **Custom Portfolio Updater Software (Planned):** A self-built backend system to manage portfolio content dynamically.
