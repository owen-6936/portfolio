# Owen Erhabor's Personal Portfolio

## Project Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a modern and dynamic web platform designed to showcase my skills and projects as a full-stack developer. Built with a focus on modern, component-based architecture, this project not only serves as a hub for my work but also as a live demonstration of my ability to build robust, scalable, and user-friendly single-page applications.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, blending foundational skills in **vanilla JavaScript** with cutting-edge front-end technologies.

## Core Technologies & Architecture

This project is built on a foundation of modern web technologies, ensuring a highly performant and maintainable application.

### Front-End

- **React:** The core library for building a dynamic, component-based user interface.

- **Framer Motion:** Used for creating smooth, aesthetically pleasing animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
- **TypeScript:** Provides static typing to enhance code quality and developer experience.

### Planned Enhancements (Future)

- **Node.js & Express:** For building the back-end of the custom content management system (CMS).
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database to dynamically store and manage portfolio content, such as projects and skills.
- **Theme Switching:** Implementing a user-selectable light/dark mode for enhanced accessibility.
- **Custom Portfolio Updater:** A self-built back-end system to allow for dynamic, real-time content management without code changes.

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable and scalable components for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Structured Navigation:** A clear and logical navigation system for seamless browsing.
- **Dynamic Content:** Future-proofed to pull project and skill data from a back-end database.
