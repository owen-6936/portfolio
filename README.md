# Owen Erhabor's Portfolio

## Project Description

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a dynamic and adaptive platform to showcase my journey, skills, and projects as an aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

This portfolio is being developed with a focus on modern, component-based architecture using React. My aim is to create a dynamic platform that not only presents my work but also demonstrates my ability to build robust, scalable, and user-friendly single-page applications.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using modern front-end technologies:

- **React:** For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **React Router:** For structured, client-side navigation.
- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** As a core foundational skill used throughout the project.

### Future Enhancements (Planned)

- **Node.js:** For the backend of the custom content management system (CMS) and portfolio updater software.
- **Database:** To store and manage portfolio content (projects, skills, etc.) dynamically.
- **Theme Switching:** Implementing light/dark mode functionality.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist & Clean Design:** Focus on readability and intuitive user experience.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable components for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Structured Navigation:** Clear navigation for easy access to all sections.
- **Home Page:** Concise introduction, top skills, and featured projects (planned).
- **About Me Page:** Detailed personal journey, skills breakdown, and motivations.
- **Projects Page:** Dedicated section to showcase individual projects with comprehensive details and visuals.
- **Contact Page:** Multiple ways to get in touch, including direct links and a contact form (planned).
- **404 Error Page:** Custom page for unhandled routes.
- **Theme Switcher (Planned):** User-selectable light and dark modes.
- **Custom Portfolio Updater Software (Planned):** A self-built backend system to manage portfolio content dynamically.
